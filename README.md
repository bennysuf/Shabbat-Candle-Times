Finding the candle lighting time in your area is just a short click away. 

Simplifying it to just a zipcode and a click, the candle lighting time and location will be displayed. 
Place any zipcode to an American city in the search bar and click "Search"

Through the API I can grab many different pieces of data from that zipcode, I chose to stick with displaying the area and candle lighting time however there are more pieces of information that can be selected and displayed. 

Due to a CORS error unable to be fixed. I added a proxy website which gives the project access to the API.
If an error shows up after having entered a valid zipcode, you may have to go on here https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and click on the button that gives "Request tempurary access to the demo server" then reload your page on the project and it should work.
